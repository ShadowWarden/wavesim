This is a simple program that models that propagation of a wave through either a single slit or a double slit setup. 

Directory structure :
src/ contains the two main source files. Each is standalone and can be run seperately. res/ is a folder with sample results that I got from a trial run. 

Prereqs :
Both wave2d and wave2slit are written in python and require the 'pylab' package preinstalled. To run, simply fire up a terminal and execute the following : 

$ python wave2d.py
for the diffraction simulation and 

$ python wave2slit.py 
for the double slit simulation.
